# Production-OS

Portfolio control plane for autonomous software production.

Production-OS manages portfolio state, prioritization, reuse, compatibility, validation, and execution feedback before handing work to `ai-dev-server`.

## Current capabilities

- GitHub portfolio discovery
- deterministic maturity scoring
- project classification
- GitHub Actions runtime-state ingestion
- bounded recursive source-tree sampling
- deep source fingerprinting
- capability fingerprinting
- source-symbol/component extraction
- component provenance
- component→dependency→capability graph
- **call/import graph refinement**
- test-to-component linking
- adaptation risk scoring
- reusable boundary detection
- automatic adaptation plans
- target-side dependency compatibility checks
- **dependency version compatibility**
- automatic validation-plan generation
- **validation-result ingestion**
- live `dbrckk/star-list` ranking
- portfolio-wide **Next Best Action**
- direct `ai-dev-server` handoff

## Knowledge graph V3

The graph now includes:

```text
repository --contains------> component
component  --depends_on----> dependency
component  --implements----> capability
component  --calls---------> symbol
repository --provides------> capability
repository --classified_as-> profile
```

This improves reusable-boundary reasoning and makes hidden coupling more visible.

## Dependency version compatibility

Production-OS compares source and target dependency versions where version evidence can be extracted.

Statuses include:

```text
exact-match
same-major-review-required
major-version-mismatch
not-present-in-target
```

A major-version mismatch blocks direct adaptation until resolved.

## Validation feedback loop

After `ai-dev-server` executes an adaptation plan, validation results can be fed back into Production-OS:

```bash
production-os validation-results \
  --plan adaptation-plan.json \
  --results validation-results.json \
  --output validation-summary.json
```

The summary reports:

```text
passed
failed
pending
blocking_failures
promotion_allowed
```

Promotion is allowed only when every required validation step has passed.

Example result:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "status": "blocked",
    "passed": 4,
    "failed": 1,
    "pending": 0,
    "blocking_failures": ["ci"]
  },
  "promotion_allowed": false
}
```

## ai-dev-server handoff V9

The handoff now includes:

- prioritized task
- repo/component reuse candidates
- adaptation risk
- reusable boundaries
- dependency compatibility
- dependency version compatibility
- missing dependencies
- major-version mismatches
- validation plan
- executable adaptation plans
- external star-list references

Promotion constraints include:

```text
resolve_missing_dependencies_before_promotion = true
reject_major_version_mismatch_before_promotion = true
complete_validation_plan_before_promotion = true
```

## Portfolio JSON V10

The full scan exports the same evidence and decisions used by the handoff, including Knowledge Graph V3 and version-aware adaptation plans.

## Design principles

- Evidence over assumptions
- Deterministic decisions before LLM judgment
- Fail closed on missing evidence
- Reuse before rebuild
- Prefer low-risk tested components
- Adapt rather than blindly copy
- Validate before promotion
- Human approval for destructive or externally privileged actions
